JavaScript (JS) is a dynamic computer programming language.
It is most commonly used as part of web browsers,          
whose implementations allow client-side scripts            
to interact with the user, control the browser,            
communicate asynchronously,                                
and alter the document content that is displayed.          
It is also being used in server-side network               
programming (with Node.js),                                
game development and the                                   
creation of desktop and mobile applications.
