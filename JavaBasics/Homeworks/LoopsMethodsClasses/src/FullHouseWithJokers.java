// In most Poker games, the "full house" hand is defined as three cards of the same face + two cards of the same face,
// other than the first, regardless of the card's suits. The cards faces are "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9",
// "10", "J", "Q", "K" and "A". The card suits are "♣", "♦", "♥" and "♠". A special card "Joker" (denoted as "*") is
// used as wildcard and can replace any other card. Jokers do not have a suite. Jokes can be used several times in a
// hand. Write a program to generate and print all full houses and print their number.
