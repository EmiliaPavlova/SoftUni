Problem 7.	Advantages of Normalized Databases
Perform a research (e.g. Google or Wikipedia) and find an information about the benefits of database normalization. Write in a text file called “database-normalization.txt”.


- Provide indexing
When the developer creates a primary key constraint, SQL Server will automatically create a unique clustered index on the column(s) for which the constraint has been created. A clustered index is created if no other clustered index has been defined for the table. In most cases, the creation of a clustered index will speed up data access and may increase insert, update, and delete performance.

- Minimize modification anomalies
Modification anomalies arise when data is inserted, updated, or deleted, and information is lost in unexpected ways. 

- Reduce table/row size
Removing duplicate data will conserve disk space and increase the amount of row space available for other fields. 

- Enforce referential integrity
