Problem 11.	Transactions
Perform a research (e.g. Google or Wikipedia) and provide a basic information about database transactions and their application? What is ACID transaction? What is transaction log? 


A transaction symbolizes a unit of work performed within a database management system (or similar system) against a database, and treated in a coherent and reliable way independent of other transactions. A transaction generally represents any change in database. A database transaction, by definition, must be atomic, consistent, isolated and durable. Database practitioners often refer to these properties of database transactions using the acronym ACID.
A transaction log is a history of actions executed by a database management system to guarantee ACID properties over crashes or hardware failures. Physically, a log is a file listing changes to the database, stored in a stable storage format.
