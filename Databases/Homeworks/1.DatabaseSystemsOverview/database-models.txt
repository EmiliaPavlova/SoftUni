Problem 1.	What Database Models do You Know?
Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide an information about different type of database models. Provide detailed information about one of the database models by your choice, different from the relational model. 


A database model is a type of data model that determines the logical structure of a database and fundamentally determines in which manner data can be stored, organized, and manipulated. The most popular example of a database model is the relational model, which uses a table-based format.

An object database
An object database (also object-oriented database management system - OODBMSs) is a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming. It combines database capabilities with object-oriented programming language capabilities. OODBMSs allow object-oriented programmers to develop the product, store them as objects, and replicate or modify existing objects to make new objects within the OODBMS. Because the database is integrated with the programming language, the programmer can maintain consistency within one environment, in that both the OODBMS and the programming language will use the same model of representation.

Some object-oriented databases are designed to work well with object-oriented programming languages such as Delphi, Ruby, Python, Perl, Java, C#, Visual Basic .NET, C++, Objective-C and Smalltalk; others have their own programming languages. OODBMSs use exactly the same model as object-oriented programming languages.
