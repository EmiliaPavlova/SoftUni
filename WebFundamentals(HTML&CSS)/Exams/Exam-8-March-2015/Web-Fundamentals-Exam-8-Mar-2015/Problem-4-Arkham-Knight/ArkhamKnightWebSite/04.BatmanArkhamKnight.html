                            The game introduces Batman's car, the Batmobile, as a driveable vehicle. The bulletproof Batmobile can be summoned to the player's location at will while on foot, or, if airborne, the car can be sent to meet Batman as he lands. The vehicle features the ability to perform jumps, speed boosts, rotate on the spot, smash through objects like barricades and trees, and fire missiles that can immobilize enemy vehicles. Batman can eject from the Batmobile and immediately begin gliding around Gotham City
